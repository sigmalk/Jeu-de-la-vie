# Game of Life
<p>The game of life is the cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970.This "Game of Life" is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.</p>
  </br>
  Itâ€™s a grid of cells where each cell can be "alive" or "dead" based on a set of rules:
  
- **Underpopulation**: A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
- **Survival**: A live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.
- **Overpopulation**: A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
- **Reproduction**: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

In this repository I'm recreating the **game of life** using **C language** in Linux.
